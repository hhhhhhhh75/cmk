				<h2>Is a Bernese Mountain Dog right for me?</h2>
				<span class="material-symbols-outlined">add</span>
			</div>
			<div class="answer" id="answer">
				<p>Please read about <a href="bernese.html">BMD's</a> on our website. There are also many websites that discuss how to find the right breed for you and we recommend doing some research before committing to any breed of dog.</p>

				<h2>What are the first steps in adopting a Bernese Mountain Dog puppy?</h2>
				<span class="material-symbols-outlined">add</span>
			</div>
			<div class="answer" id="answer">
				<p>Please fill out an adoption form on our website and include as much detail as possible
about yourself and what you are looking for in a dog. This will help us determine if you
are suitable candidates for one of our puppies. It will also help us decide which Bernese
Mountain Dog puppy is a good match for you. If you have not heard of us within 3 days,
please e-mail or phone, as sometimes the adoption forms can go missing. We require a
$250 non-refundable deposit to reserve your puppy.</p>

			<div class="question-info">
				<h2>How does the Bernese Mountain Dog puppy selection work?</h2>
				<span class="material-symbols-outlined">add</span>
			</div>
			<div class="answer" id="answer">
				<p>We use the information that you have filled out on your adoption form, so please include
lots of details when telling us about your lifestyle, puppy preferences etc. We will send
out pictures at about 3 and 8 weeks of age of all the puppies. At about 7-8 weeks of
age, we temperament test each of our Bernese Mountain Dog puppies and profile them.
Then we go back to the adoption forms to make the best match for each person. The
puppies go home at about 9 weeks of age.</p>

				<h2>Does the Bernese Mountain Dog puppy need to be spayed or neutered?</h2>
				<span class="material-symbols-outlined">add</span>
			</div>
			<div class="answer" id="answer">
				<p>Yes, the Bernese Mountain puppies will need to be spayed or neutered. We
recommend doing it around 8 months of age. We are willing to work with your vet if they
have a different age in mind. If you would like to show/breed we do make exceptions.
We look at each case individually.</p>

				<h2>What does the Bernese Mountain Dog puppy need to cross the border or fly?</h2>
				<span class="material-symbols-outlined">add</span>
			</div>
			<div class="answer" id="answer">
				<p>Our vet will give the puppy a thorough health exam. He will then issue a health
certificate, along with an international health certificate. We will also provide an official
invoice with receipt of payment. This is all the puppy needs to cross the border if the
puppy is flying to his new home.</p>

				<p>We love to keep in touch with the families that adopt a puppy from us! We appreciate
getting updates and pictures. In fact, we ask that you send us pictures of your dog at
four months, eight months, and one year along with their weight at each age. We can
then let you know how your Bernese Mountain Dog pup is doing in comparison to the
rest of the litter. Also, if you ever have any questions we want you to feel free to email or
phone us.</p>
