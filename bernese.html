		<h2>Origin of the Bernese Mountain Dog</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Bernese Mountain Dogs originate from Switzerland, with images found dating back to the 17th century.  Written descriptions of Berners date back to the mid-19th century when they were used as herding dogs throughout the Alps.  Later, they were also used for drafting (pulling carts) and were always regarded as a good watchdog. The Bernese Mountain dog has become popular throughout many parts of the world.  Due to their ever increasing popularity and over breeding from small gene pools, the breed has suffered many health problems and a shortened life span.  </p>
		<h2 style="padding-top:15px;">What are the characteristics of a Bernese Moutain Dog?</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>The Bernese Mountain dog has become a favorite breed, not only for their work ethic and companionship, but also because they are an alert, affectionate, and good-natured dog. A Berner is intelligent and appreciates responsibility. They have a strong genetic drive to please their family and love to be with their people in their daily activities. They are also extremely child friendly and interact well with seniors.  Another characteristic of Bernese Mountain dogs is that they are generally not a high-energy or intense breed, especially in comparison to a Lab or Retriever. They love long walks, but are not suited for endurance runs. It is also important to avoid intense exercise (especially in warm weather) because of their thick coat and the possibility of overheating. If you are looking for a highly energetic dog, then a Berner will not be the right fit for you.  Today, Bernese Mountain Dogs are not commonly used as work dogs, but instead are bred to be family pets. It should also be noted that Berners are not hunting dogs or guard dogs. They make great ‘alarm’ dogs (i.e. they will bark and let you know someone is approaching), but they will not attack. Instead, they will often greet visitors with some initial barking and then a wagging tail! </p>

		<h2 style="padding-top:15px">How should Bernese Mountain Dogs be trained?</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Bernese Mountain dogs are sensitive and should be trained firmly, but gently.  Owners will run into issues with this dog if they do not display strong leadership towards the dog.  Treating them like a baby or member of the family will lead to many problems as they grow up.  People need to show that they are the Pack leader.  Failure to do so can result in a different dog than described above. A Bernese Mountain dog needs to clearly understand the rules so that it can follow them and feel secure.</p>
		<h2 style="padding-top:15px">How much do Bernese Mountain Dogs weigh?</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Bernese Mountain dogs can vary in weight.  Their averages range from 80 to 120lbs.  The males are generally a little bigger than the females.  The main health problems that are seen in Bernese Mountain dogs are hip and elbow dysplasia, and cancer. Overexerting Bernese Mountain dogs in their growing years can lead to hip and elbow problems.  They, also, gain weight easily because they are not highly active.  Being over weight can lead to numerous health problems, so it is imperative not to overfeed. </p>
		<h2  style="padding-top:15px">Bernese Mountain Dog maintenance</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>It is advisable to have a fenced yard for a Berner to play in or to go on walks with them daily (or both).  Their coat will need to be brushed daily or weekly depending on the length and thickness of their coat.  Extra brushing is necessary when shedding takes place. Although the Bernese is an intelligent dog and not a high-energy breed, training and regular exercise is vitally important. Therefore, we strongly recommend that all owners train their puppy through a community obedience program and walk their dog daily.</p>
